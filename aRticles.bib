In spring, this native to the North American prairies bears spikes of pea-shaped indigo blue flowers, resembling Lupines. They last for about three weeks and attract butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds. When the flowers fade away, the lovely blue-green, trifoliate leaves remain neat and form a lovely backdrop for the other perennials in the garden.

It is native to eastern and central North America from Saskatchewan east to Newfoundland and south as far as Texas, New Mexico, and Georgia.Heliopsis helianthoides is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial growing 40–150 cm (16–59 in) tall. The toothed leaf blades are oval to triangular or lance-shaped and may be smooth or hairy or rough in texture. The flowers are produced from midsummer to early autumn (fall). The inflorescence contains one to many composite flowerheads. Each head contains yellow ray florets which are generally 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long. The rays are fertile, having a small forked pistil at the base; this distinguishes them from true sunflowers. At the center are many yellow to brownish disc florets. The fruit is an achene about 5 mm (0.20 in) long.In the wild, H. helianthoides may be found in wooded areas and tallgrass prairie, and sometimes along roadsides.It is a popular garden plant for moist, fertile soil in full sun. Plants grow stiff and tall, so may require staking. Several cultivars are available with flowers of varying colors and shades. These include “Summer Sun”, “Golden Plume”, and “Prairie Sunset”.

The shape of the bracts distinguishes this species from others, for example Liatris spicata, another tall Liatris species that has thickly packed spikes, but whose bracts are flat with rounded tips.The root system is a corm that sometimes develops into a rhizome. It produces offsets and gradually forms a clump. Its native habitats include prairies, open woods, and meadows. The plant attracts birds, hummingbirds, and butterflies.The species epithet comes from Ancient Greek πυκνός (puknós) “dense” and στάχυς (stákhus) “ear of grain”, referring to the thickly packed spike of flowers.
